# stock_predictor

## Features

- Developed a **Stock Price Prediction** project using machine learning algorithms to forecast stock prices for companies like AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, IBM, MSFT, and NVDA.
- Implemented data fetching from **Yahoo Finance** using Python scripts for real-time stock data analysis.
- Built and trained machine learning models with **scikit-learn** for stock price prediction and evaluated performance using backtesting and k-fold cross-validation techniques.
- Designed interactive visualizations for algorithm comparison, backtesting results, and validation metrics using **Matplotlib**.
- Created a **Streamlit application** for real-time stock prediction visualization and user interaction.
- Utilized **Jupyter Notebooks** for exploratory data analysis and experimentation with different prediction models.
- Organized project structure with modular scripts and company-specific data folders for scalability and maintainability.
- Leveraged Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `streamlit`, and `yfinance` for data processing, modeling, and visualization.
